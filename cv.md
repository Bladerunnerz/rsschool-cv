3. I am 47 years old. For the last 15 years, my work has been associated with computer technology, at first, and then with technical support for Internet users. Continuing to do the same is not interesting and unpromising. I decided to master a new profession and chose programming.
For 30 years of working experience, I have mastered new things more than once and became a specialist everywhere. I am sure that despite my age, I will be able to achieve good results in this new profession for me.
